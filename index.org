* Why?
  “Learning to drive a car takes effort. Is that a reason to keep driving your bicycle?
  No, you realize you need to invest time to learn a skill. Text editing isn’t different.
  You need to learn new commands and turn them into a habit.” - Bram Moolenaar
* Real Why?
** It's fast
** I don't need to remember
** It's light weight and everywhere I go
** It's light on my fingers too
* A little Walkthrough of Vim
** Starting Vim
  vim <file-name>

  vim +NUM <file-name>

  vim +cmd or -c cmd <file-name>
